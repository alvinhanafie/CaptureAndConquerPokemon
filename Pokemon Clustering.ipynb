However, using this approach may lead to oversimplicity, as players cannot identify 'Moderate' Pokémon between Weak and Strong Pokémon. This can lead to steep difficulty curves when players in the middle of transition from early to late game. We can use 2 clusters approach as an alternative if we prefer simplicity in Pokémon cluster.\n\nThe use of 4 clusters provides more information to players, which capable to tell more specific characteristics of Pokémon in each group. By using this approach, players can be better at strategize which Pokémon that is suitable for their playstyle.\n\nAdditionally, we have two more categories of Pokémon that belongs to middle game in 4 clusters type, as representation of 'Moderate' Pokémon. This options are not available if we use 2 clusters type approach.\n\nPersonally, 4 clusters approach is preferred it can give more valuable insights to players instead of just classifying Pokémon as weak and strong. In this approach, players can also consider which Pokémon is worth trying to catch, based on their playstyle preferences.","metadata":{"id":"4bac85ce"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Assign 4 Clusters Type Result to Original Dataset","metadata":{"id":"13b7b4d2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df['cluster'] = kmeans.labels_","metadata":{"id":"b89074d6","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-20T05:23:16.283574Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-20T05:23:16.284309Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-20T05:23:16.291343Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-20T05:23:16.284273Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-20T05:23:16.2899Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# add pokedex number and name for easier readibility\n# selecting only clustered features for better clarity\n\nselected_features = ['pokedex_number', 'name', 'hp', 'attack', 'defense', 'sp_attack', 'sp_defense', 'speed', 'capture_rate', 'cluster']\nselected_df = df[selected_features]\n\n# Define cluster names instead of cluster number for better interpretation\n\ncluster_names = {\n    0: '(Agile) Middle Game',\n    1: '(Durable) Middle Game',\n    2: 'Early Game',\n    3: 'Late Game'\n}\n\n# Replace cluster labels with descriptive cluster names\n\nselected_df = selected_df.copy()\nselected_df['cluster'] = selected_df['cluster'].map(cluster_names)\n\n# show cluster samples for the first 20 Pokémon as an example\n\nselected_df.sample(20, random_state=42)","metadata":{"id":"bb154c29","outputId":"b10fa9ef-bd05-44b1-ed08-67203f97f791","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-20T05:23:16.293281Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-20T05:23:16.293609Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-20T05:23:16.322518Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-20T05:23:16.293581Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-20T05:23:16.321278Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Checking Cluster Assignment","metadata":{"id":"4fa87fbb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To check whether clustering is properly done, we will inspect the cluster for Pikachu and Raichu as an example.
